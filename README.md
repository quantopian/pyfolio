pyfolio is a Python library for performance and risk analysis of
financial portfolios developed by
[Quantopian Inc](https://www.quantopian.com). It works well with the
[Zipline](http://zipline.io) open source backtesting library.

At the core of pyfolio is a so-called tear sheet that consists of
various individual plots that provide a comprehensive image of the
performance of a trading algorithm. Here's an example of a simple tear
sheet analyzing a strategy:

pyfolio](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/quantopian/pyfolio/blob/master/pyfolio/examples/pyfolio_talk_slides.ipynb#/).

## Installation

To install pyfolio, run:

```bash
pip install pyfolio
```

#### Development

For development, you may want to use a [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) to avoid dependency conflicts between pyfolio and other Python projects you have. To get set up with a virtual env, run:
```bash
mkvirtualenv pyfolio
```

Next, clone this git repository and run `python setup.py develop`
and edit the library files directly.

#### Bayesian tear sheet

Generating a [Bayesian tearsheet](https://github.com/quantopian/pyfolio/blob/master/pyfolio/examples/bayesian.ipynb) requires PyMC3 and Theano. You can install these packages with the following commands:

```bash
pip install theano
```

```bash
pip install pymc3
```

#### Matplotlib on OSX

If you are on OSX and using a non-framework build of Python, you may need to set your backend:
``` bash
echo "backend: TkAgg" > ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc
```

## Usage

A good way to get started is to run the pyfolio examples in
a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/). To do this, you first want to
start a Jupyter notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

From the notebook list page, navigate to the pyfolio examples directory
and open a notebook. Execute the code in a notebook cell by clicking on it
and hitting Shift+Enter.
