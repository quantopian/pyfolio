pyfolio is a Python library for performance and risk analysis of
financial portfolios developed by
[Quantopian Inc](https://www.quantopian.com). It works well with the
[Zipline](http://zipline.io) open source backtesting library.

At the core of pyfolio is a so-called tear sheet that consists of
various individual plots that provide a comprehensive image of the
performance of a trading algorithm. Here is an example of a tear sheet of a returns-based analysis of the `$FB` stock:
