# What's New

These are new features and improvements of note in each release.

## v0.8.0 (Aug 23rd, 2017)

This is a major release from `0.7.0`, and all users are recommended to upgrade.

### New features

 - Risk tear sheet: added a new tear sheet to analyze risk exposures to common factors (e.g. mean reversion and momentum), sector (e.g. Morningstar sectors), market cap and illiquid stocks. By [George Ho](https://github.com/eigenfoo).
 - Simple tear sheet: added a new tear sheet that presents only the most important plots in the full tear sheet, for a quick general overview of a portfolio's performance. By [George Ho](https://github.com/eigenfoo).
 - Performance attribution: added new table to do performance attribution
   analysis, such as the amount of returns attributable to common factors, and
   summary statistics such as the multi-factor alpha and multi-factor Sharpe ratio. By [Vikram Narayan](https://github.com/vikram-narayan).
 - Volatility plot: added a rolling annual volatility plot to the returns tear sheet. By [hkopp](https://github.com/hkopp).

### Bugfixes

 - Yahoo and pandas data-reader: fixed bug regarding Yahoo backend for market data and pandas data-reader. By [Thomas Wiecki](https://github.com/twiecki) and [Gus Gordon](https://github.com/gusgordon).
 - `empyrical` compatibility: removed `information_ratio` to remain compatible with `empyrical`. By [Thomas Wiecki](https://github.com/twiecki).
 - Fama-French rolling multivariate regression: fixed bug where the rolling Fama-French plot performed separate linear regressions instead of a multivariate regression. By [George Ho](https://github.com/eigenfoo).
 - Other minor bugfixes. By [Scott Sanderson](https://github.com/ssanderson),
   [Jonathan Ng](https://github.com/jonathanng),
   [SylvainDe](https://github.com/SylvainDe) and
   [mckelvin](https://github.com/mckelvin).

### Maintenance

 - Documentation: updated and improved `pyfolio` documentation and example
   Jupyter notebooks. By [George Ho](https://github.com/eigenfoo).
 - Data loader migration: all data loaders have been migrated from `pyfolio` to
   `empyrical`. By [James Christopher](https://github.com/jameschristopher).
 - Improved plotting style: fixed issues with formatting and presentation of
   plots. By [George Ho](https://github.com/eigenfoo).

## v0.7.0 (Jan 28th, 2017)

This is a major release from `0.6.0`, and all users are recommended to upgrade.

### New features

 - Adds a transaction timing plot, which gives insight into the strategies' trade times.
 - Adds a plot showing the number of longs and shorts held over time.
 - New round trips plot selects a sample of held positions (16 by default) and shows their round trips. This replaces the old round trip plot, which became unreadable for strategies that traded many positions.
 - Adds basic capability for analyzing intraday strategies. If a strategy makes a large amount of transactions relative to its end-of-day positions, then pyfolio will attempt to reconstruct the intraday positions, take the point of peak exposure to the market during each day, and plot that data with the positions tear sheet. By default pyfolio will automatically detect this, but the behavior can be changed by passing either `estimate_intraday=True` or `estimate_intraday=False` to the tear sheet functions ([see here](https://github.com/quantopian/pyfolio/blob/master/pyfolio/tears.py#L131)).
 - Now formats [zipline](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline) assets, displaying their ticker symbol.
 - Gross leverage is no longer required to be passed, and will now be calculated from the passed positions DataFrame.

### Bugfixes

 - Cone plotting location is now correct.
 - Adjust scaling of beta and Fama-French plots.
 - Removed multiple dependencies, some of which were previously unused.
 - Various text fixes.

## v0.6.0 (Oct 17, 2016)

By [Ana Ruelas](https://github.com/ahgnaw) and [Abhi Kalyan](https://github.com/abhijeetkalyan).
